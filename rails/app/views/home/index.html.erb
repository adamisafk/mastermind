<!--
  Welcome to Tailwind Play, the official Tailwind CSS playground!

  Everything here works just like it does when you're running Tailwind locally
  with a real build pipeline. You can customize your config file, use features
  like `@apply`, or even add third-party plugins.

  Feel free to play with this example if you're just learning, or trash it and
  start from scratch if you know enough to be dangerous. Have fun!
